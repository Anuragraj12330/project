The Python code performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on student hostel utility data, including electricity consumption, water usage, and total cost. It begins by importing required libraries and creating a sample monthly dataset using Pandas. Descriptive statistics are generated to analyze average usage, spread, and variability, while variance is calculated to measure fluctuations in consumption. Line plots are used to visualize monthly trends in electricity, water, and cost, helping to identify peak usage periods and seasonal patterns. Overall, the code demonstrates how EDA techniques and visualizations can support efficient resource management and data-driven decision-making.
